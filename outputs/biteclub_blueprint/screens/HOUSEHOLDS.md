# HOUSEHOLDS — Your household

Explicit household memberships and shared settings; paid access and circle membership are separate.

- Group: Membership; proposed phase: P3; actor: member.
- Feature coverage: F44.
- Backend owner: commerce; households · packs · entitlements · purchase_events.
- Layout: Mobile stack: app bar, current context, labelled fields/content, primary action, secondary actions, bottom navigation.
- Entry data: `GET /v1/households`, `GET /v1/entitlements`.
- Context: Resolve typed resource IDs from authorized navigation context; no URL or client ID is trusted as proof of access. New/create modes skip nonexistent-resource GET and use local drafts. Empty/missing picker context returns to the documented parent.

## Serialization contracts

UI labels and example fixtures are not wire fields. Typed use cases resolve selected labels to canonical IDs, convert display enums and combine validated draft data with authorized route context. Generated request types must follow the linked OpenAPI schema; never serialize arbitrary form state. User authentication also requires the registered X-Device-Session header per the API.

- **HOUSEHOLDS.01**: HouseholdWrite; required body fields: name; body fields available: name; required operation headers: X-Device-Session, Idempotency-Key.
- **HOUSEHOLDS.05**: No JSON body; required body fields: none; body fields available: none; required operation headers: X-Device-Session, Idempotency-Key, If-Match.
- **HOUSEHOLDS.06**: No JSON body; required body fields: none; body fields available: none; required operation headers: X-Device-Session, Idempotency-Key, If-Match.

## States and design acceptance

- loading: Preserve known context and reserve content geometry; disable only conflicting actions.
- empty: Explicit household memberships and shared settings; paid access and circle membership are separate.
- error: Show the typed action error next to its trigger, retain non-secret input and expose recovery.
- offline: Use eligible private cache or a clear reconnect state; never simulate publication, payment, or authorization success.
- Validate default and conditional destinations, form errors, current role, lost responses, keyboard/text scaling, safe Back and applicable offline behavior on both native platforms.
