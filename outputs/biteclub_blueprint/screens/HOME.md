## Inherited bottom navigation

- HOME.nav1: **Cook** → HOME. Preserve draft where applicable; destination data is independently authorized.
- HOME.nav2: **Cookbook** → COOKBOOK. Preserve draft where applicable; destination data is independently authorized.

## Serialization contracts

UI labels and example fixtures are not wire fields. Typed use cases resolve selected labels to canonical IDs, convert display enums and combine validated draft data with authorized route context. Generated request types must follow the linked OpenAPI schema; never serialize arbitrary form state. User authentication also requires the registered X-Device-Session header per the API.


## States and design acceptance

- loading: Preserve known context and reserve content geometry; disable only conflicting actions.
- empty: Cooking-first home: prominent meal request, recent reliable meals and a compact Today preview. Empty state works with zero friends.
- error: Show the typed action error next to its trigger, retain non-secret input and expose recovery.
- offline: Use eligible private cache or a clear reconnect state; never simulate publication, payment, or authorization success.
- Validate default and conditional destinations, form errors, current role, lost responses, keyboard/text scaling, safe Back and applicable offline behavior on both native platforms.
